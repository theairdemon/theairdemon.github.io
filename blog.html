		The first of my literature reviews. 
		I begin with an overview of the upcoming series of posts, and then dive into the paper "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00306" target="_blank">Evolutionary Algorithms Are Significantly More Robust to Noise When They Ignore It</a>". 
		This paper, by Anitpov and Doerr, serves as a great introduction to reading computer science research papers. 
		I then explain random search heuristics, and give a brief overview of evolutionary algorithms.

		Third party addons are great for reducing duplicated code, and they can streamline the development process - when implemented correctly. 
		Unfortunately, when added to a webpage by someone with little-to-no knowledge of that webpage, we can find bugs that are extremely difficult to fix. 
		We need to have patience and diligence to push through these issues, along with open communication with our team and the offending party.

		<p>
		<b><i>Published 8/29/24</i></b>
		</p>
		<p>
		Refactoring code can drastically improve performance. 
		In this case, refactoring reduced page load time by streamlining data retrieval and removing bottlenecks caused by legacy code. 
		Always keep in mind: it's important to hold to your own beliefs, and the push back when you know your solution will improve the customer experience.
