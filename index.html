        <h3><a href="https://github.com/theairdemon/musicGenerator" target="_blank">Music Generator</a></h3>
        <p>Using music theory and random number generators, I built a python
          program that creates MIDI files (digital music instructions). A
          musician can simply click-and-drag the files into a DAW (digital audio
          workstation), and they'd immediately have a full song, comprised of
          chords, melodies, and harmonies.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/theairdemon/CellularAutomata" target="_blank">Cellular Automata</a></h3>
        <p>As an experiment in artificial life, and to improve my C++ skills, I
          built a simulation of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway's Game of Life</a>, using SFML to render the simple 2D graphics. Using those cells as a
          foundation, I then built what I call the "least-optimized Tetris game
          ever". Instead of blocks that fall from the top of the screen to the
          bottom, this version of Tetris implements a custom variation of
          Conway's Game of Life rules, and can take the user's input to modify
          the state of the game.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/theairdemon/themedPoemGenerator" target="_blank">Poem Generator</a></h3>
        <p>My first major undertaking, and one that I am still proud of; I built
          and published an Android app,
          <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycompany.poetry" target="_blank">PoemGen</a>. Similar to the Music Generator, this application uses common poetic
          nouns, verbs, and adjectives to randomly generate poetry on-demand. It
          can also generate haiku, using a more limited list of words (to
          account for syllables).</p>

        <h3><a href="https://digitalcommons.dartmouth.edu/masters_theses/115/" target="_blank">Underwater Robot Path Planning in an Intermittent Communication
            System
          </a></h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Sunflower, a novel cross-medium localization system
          between an aerial drone and an underwater robot, has not yet been
          implemented in a multi-robot exploration system. This projectâ€™s aim
          was to simulate various configurations of multi-robot systems, and to
          create an algorithm, called AdjustPath, to improve exploration and
          avoid inter- robot collisions. With three, five, seven, and ten
          simulated underwater robots, there was significant improvement when
          the AdjustPath algorithm was used. Knowing this, future hardware using
          the Sunflower system could use this proposed algorithm to increase
          efficiency and avoid more collisions.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3498361.3539773" target="_blank">Sunflower: locating underwater robots from the air</a></h3>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Locating underwater robots is fundamental for
          enabling important underwater applications. The current mainstream
          method requires a physical infrastructure with relays on the water
          surface, which is largely ad-hoc, introduces a significant logistical
          overhead, and entails limited scalability. Our work, Sunflower,
          presents the first demonstration of wireless, 3D localization across
          the air-water interface - eliminating the need for additional
          infrastructure on the water surface. Specifically, we propose a
          laser-based sensing system to enable aerial drones to directly locate
          underwater robots. The Sunflower system consists of a queen and a
          worker component on a drone and each tracked underwater robot,
          respectively.</p>
